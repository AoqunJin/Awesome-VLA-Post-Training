## :earth_asia: Enhancing Environmental Perception

This section explores methods that improve an agent’s ability to perceive and interpret its environment. It includes **affordance-guided learning**, which enables agents to understand actionable properties of objects; **enhanced encoders** tailored for manipulation tasks, allowing more precise feature extraction; and **improved representation learning**, which helps models build richer and more structured environmental understanding for downstream tasks.

### Affordance-Guided Learning

### Enhanced Encoder for Manipulation

### Enhanced Representation for Manipulation

## :brain: Improving Embodiment Awareness

Here we focus on helping agents better understand their own physical structure and capabilities. Topics include **forward and inverse kinematics learning**, which allow agents to model the relationship between joint movements and spatial positions, and **action head design**, aimed at optimizing how high-level decisions are translated into low-level motor commands.

### Forward kinematics learning

### Inverse kinematics learning

### Action Head Designing

## :memo: Deepening Task Comprehension

This section covers methods that enable agents to better understand and generalize across tasks. Key areas include **human–robot interaction**, where agents learn to interpret and respond to human inputs effectively, and **hierarchical task manipulation**, which enables multi-step reasoning and planning by decomposing complex tasks into structured subtasks.

### Human–Robot-Interaction

### Hierarchical Task Manipulation
